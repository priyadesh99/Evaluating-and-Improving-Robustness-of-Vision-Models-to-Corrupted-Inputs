# Evaluating and Improving Robustness of Vision Models to Corrupted Inputs

## Overview

This repository explores methods for measuring and enhancing the robustness of pretrained vision models (e.g., ResNet-18) when faced with common input corruptions. We leverage the CIFAR-10-C dataset to evaluate model performance across different corruption types and severities, and implement strategies such as mixed clean/noise fine-tuning, selective layer adaptation, and trasnfer learning.
